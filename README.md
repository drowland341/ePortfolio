##  About Me

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

My name is Douglas Rowland, a software engineer with a deep interest in building software that is not only reliable and scalable, but also tightly integrated with hardware systems. I‚Äôm especially passionate about embedded systems and the challenge of writing efficient code that directly interacts with physical devices. Whether I‚Äôm working on mobile applications, console-based utilities, or low-level hardware interfaces, I prioritize function, reliability, and clean architecture. This portfolio highlights my practical experience in developing robust software with real-world use cases, showcasing my strengths in object-oriented programming, database structure, mobile development, and automated testing ‚Äî with a focus on performance and long-term maintainability.


##  Featured Artifacts

###  Inventory Management App (Android)
A full-featured inventory tracking mobile application built in Android Studio.

**Key Features:**
- Material Design UI with add, edit, delete, and update capabilities  
- Advanced sorting and search functionality  
- Admin-only access to generate test data (100+ items)  
- Log viewer for tracking item activity (add/edit/delete)  
- Optimized database access using List-based architecture instead of cursors

 Screenshots:
- `InventoryApp1.png` ‚Äì App UI with search and item list  
- `InventoryApp2.png` ‚Äì Log viewer screen  
- `InventoryApp3.png` ‚Äì Add/update item screen  
- `InventoryApp4.png` ‚Äì Admin test data generation view


###  Appointment Management System (Java Console App)
A Java-based console application focused on contacts, tasks, and appointment creation with detailed validation and test coverage.

**Key Features:**
- OOP structure for maintainable and extendable code  
- Data validation at all entry points  
- High test coverage (98%+ instruction coverage across core modules)  
- JUnit 5 tests to validate expected behavior and edge cases

 Test Coverage Comparison:
- `appointmentServiceBEFORE.png` ‚Äì Initial code coverage  
- `appointmentServiceAFTER.png` ‚Äì Final improved code coverage


##  Self-Assessment
