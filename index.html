      <h1>Doug Rowland - Professional Self-Assessment</h1>
      <p>
        Throughout my time in the Computer Science program at SNHU, I have grown significantly as a developer and problem-solver. I came into this program with a basic interest in programming and graduated with a deeper understanding of how software impacts nearly every part of modern life. Working on the ePortfolio gave me a chance to showcase the projects I’m proud of and to reflect on how far I’ve come.
      </p>
      <p>
        My coursework helped shape not only my technical skills but also my mindset as a future software engineer. From learning how to write clean, maintainable code to understanding best practices for secure software design, each class added a new layer to my knowledge. Whether it was getting better at debugging, organizing code more effectively, or improving test coverage, I gained real-world habits that will stick with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn’t have many opportunities for group collaboration during this program, but I still learned a lot about working independently and managing projects on my own. I’ve become more comfortable communicating through documentation, GitHub commits, and detailed commenting to help others understand my work. Even without constant feedback, I learned how to critically evaluate my own work and find ways to improve it.
      </p>
      <p>
        My technical strengths include software design and engineering, database structure, and algorithmic logic. I’ve especially enjoyed taking existing projects and finding ways to make them more efficient or user-friendly. For example, switching from cursors to list-based handling in my Inventory App helped streamline the entire UI logic and made it easier to implement sorting and searching features.

      <h3>Inventory App - Algorithms and Database</h3>
      <p>
        This Android app allows users to manage inventory items with features like adding, updating, and deleting. Admin users can generate test data for validation and view activity logs, which are tracked in a dedicated database table. I implemented sorting options, search filters, and replaced Cursor logic with a List to simplify interaction and performance.

      <h3>Appointment Management System - Software Engineering</h3>
      <p>
        This Java-based console app allows creation, deletion, and updates of contact and task objects with full validation. I focused on building out unit test coverage, hitting over 95 percent instruction coverage. This helped surface edge-case bugs and improved the reliability of the system significantly.
